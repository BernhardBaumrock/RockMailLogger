From PW Weekly:

New module: WireMail Mail Logger by Bernhard Baumrock
WireMail Mail Logger, also known as RockMailLogger, is a new module released just this week by Bernhard Baumrock. In a nutshell this module adds an entry to a ProcessWire log file for each message sent using WireMail.

The mail logging feature provided by this module can be quite helpful while debugging email related issues, but also if you just want to check what kind of messages your site is actually sending out. WireMail Mail Logger is also really easy to get started with: just install it and you're good to go. Log entries can be viewed via ProcessWire's log viewer.

Keep in mind, though, that since the message itself will indeed be logged, you probably don't want to enable this module on a production site in case you're sending messages that shouldn't be fully readable by superusers.

You can install this module via the built-in module installer, or â€“ in case you prefer the manual installation method â€“ you can grab the code from the RockMailLogger GitHub repository. If you have any questions or require support, head down to the dedicated support forum thread.

Thanks to Bernhard for sharing this module with us!
